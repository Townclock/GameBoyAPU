#Tracker

The tracker will consist of 4 pages
  one to lay out a sequence of patterns for each channel
  one where the patterns for the channels can be modified and edited
  one to examine and create waveforms for the the programmable waveform channel
  one to allow users to import and export their arrangements via JSON, to save their compositions withing the browser, and to (maybe) export their compositions as an mp3
