known bugs:

JS AUDIO API

***When frequency is at a high value, and a low value is input, you can hear the pulse channel sweep down from the high value 5

**50% uptime pulse waveform does not sound like the API's built in "square" wave form, 25% and 12.5% waveforms are probably also inaccurate.


*Pulse channels use forier transformations to generate pulse shape waves, but
  pulse shaped waves could likely be shaped with a single bit buffer like noise is
  with hardware-ish accurate up-times for given frequencies

sweep shifts are not actuarate to the fractional millesecond

*25% & 75% waveform cycles are not necessarily equivalent

***** Lots of click/popping: I think this is due to using js to update it with a timer or some such



PROGRAMMING

No Master Control registers
No LEFT/RIGHT speaker controls for any channel

PAPU state is not stored in a analogous memory structure analogous to the original chip

Innacurate LFSR starting state

***** Noise is only being updated every millesecond. Need to you a more accurate clock

*** sound length should be controlled by sound control registers, not by setting volume
